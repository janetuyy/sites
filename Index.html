            <h2>1. THEY EVEN BEHAVE LIKE OTHER RODENTS</h2>
            <p id="text">Belonging to the cavy family (Caviidae), their closest relatives are actually guinea pigs and rock cavies.
                They're essentially the rodent version of the hippopotamus—gnawing their food whilst swimming in the South American swamps. 
                On a slightly grosser note, these guys eat their own dung to extract maximum nutrition from their food—much like rabbits. 
                Don't try that at home, folks!</p>

            <h2>2. CAPYBARAS ARE FANTASTIC SWIMMERS</h2>
            <p id="text">Capybaras can always be found living near bodies of water due to their semi-aquatic lifestyle. 
                Along the banks of the Amazon River, these murky waters harbour many threats for a Capybara, 
                but life by the water is still the perfect spot to set up camp—allowing them to retreat quickly and escape from predators like anacondas, wild cats and even eagles.
                Webbed feet help them to maneuver in water, and their facial features are located towards the top of their large heads to help them see and breathe while they swim. 
                Pretty neat, huh?!</p>

            </div>
            <h2>3. THEY CAN EVEN SLEEP IN WATER</h2>
            <p id="text">Capybaras can dive and stay underwater for up to 5 minutes at a time—often falling asleep in the water whilst keeping their nose at the edge of the banks. 
                Napping along rivers, mangroves and marshes helps them to stay cool.3 Who could blame them in the hot Amazonian sun?</p>

            <h2>4. BUT THEY'RE ALSO EXTREMELY AGILE ON LAND</h2>
            <p id="text">While Capybaras feel at home by the water's edge, 
                they certainly know their way around the land, 
                and are capable of reaching speeds of up to 35 kilometers an hour—that's as fast as a horse!</p>

            <h2>5. THEY HAVE A UNIQUE VOCAL REPERTOIRE</h2>
            <p id="text">Capybaras are rather vocal animals. 
                They like to express themselves by purring, barking, cackling, whistling, squealing, whining, grunting and even teeth-chattering—depending on what they're trying to communicate. 
                Not only are there harmonic differences among social groups, but each sound a Capybara makes bears a significant meaning.
                Alerts from group members can be environmental cues, including as danger from predators and isolation of their young.</p>
